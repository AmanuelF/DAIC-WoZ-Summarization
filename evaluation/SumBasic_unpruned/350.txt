participant was asked what advice would they give yourself ten or twenty years ago , then participant said to just relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and they do not mean to sound that way but it is true it is just she have to learn how to be comfortable with she and relax and just know she to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where she are supposed to be or what she are supposed to be doing at that time it does not mean that she are less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their their time and their progression to how they get to things so they would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that they want for my life and do not be  .
participant was asked yeah , then participant said yeah  .
