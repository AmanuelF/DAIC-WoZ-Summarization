participant was asked okay, then participant said and they do some technology gigs sometimes she know it is do some recording some live sound stuff but they is kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again they wanna get away from that they wanna go back to the  .
participant was asked yeah, then participant said so they i like they like doing that .
participant was asked what are some things that make they really mad, then participant said  things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can not fight back and they are mean to them just because they can not fight back and they actually like to see people who are strong as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate .
participant was asked whatever comes to your mind, then participant said  the last thing they can think of was they argued with my husband about the care of my mother in law cause she is got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her cause she will not go anywhere but la they mean she is like hardcore angelino like she know we we know we are the we are that in our nature but we also know it is cheaper to live elsewhere but so we came out here to take care of her  .
participant was asked wow, then participant said sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so they is thinking well if they did not if they had taken care of better care of myself would they have been able to take better care of her and they know there was not anything they would have been able to do to prevent her death but what if they if they would they have been be able to make it easier on her if they would have taken care of myself and that is like one huge regret that they have .
participant was asked she see how have they been feeling lately , then participant said  very anxious and nervous and they mean what if they do not find enough she know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if she know what what if they can not keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it is actually hard work to be stable and they know it is hard work to be stable but what she know it is just eh a lot of what ifs and and they do not think it is things that have not happened and it is stupid and pointless to worry about things that have not happened and they know that but it still happens it still creeps in so that is actually a source of anxiety but then she try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it but they i they know it it is a cycle .
participant was asked thanks for sharing your thoughts with me , then participant said thank she  .
