881.4780000000002	887.565	ellie	 tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
888.6469999999998	899.482	participant	hm there is one recently my father passed away recently
899.931	900.671	ellie	i am sorry
900.897	991.165	participant	thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time is passed i wish i would invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really did not invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could have easily done it via email or it is hard to call everybody personally but i wish that is something cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you did not tell me notil after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i am not really mad at myself about something i probably should have been more prepared for also something that was coming was inevitable so
991.977	996.764	ellie	i see tell me about your relationship with your family
997.615	1023.77	participant	 well both my parents are recently deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we are not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell painting i guess we are also different

1024.385	1043.615	participant	and i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it is strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we are all all so different
1044.224	1047.979	ellie	yeah i understand
1048.2	1061.112	participant	yeah it is yeah just being that is how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody is great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff
1062.997	1065.037	ellie	have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd
1066.042	1092.432	participant	 no but i thought probably i could have had it before from some other events in my life and i just was not sure i have had been to some therapy in the past just from you know i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that is exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just was not sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
1093.662	1095.512	ellie	why would you decide to enlist in the military
1095.677	1100.442	participant	i did not enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies
1101.406	1103.156	ellie	how old were you when you joined the military
1101.527	1116.132	participant	that seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it is more prestige it just is not enlisting it is the hard where i went it is the hardest school in america to get into
1328.4070000000004	1329.787	ellie	how have you been feeling lately
1330.4260000000004	1339.906	participant	i feel pretty good lately you know i have been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much

1345.381	1350.081	participant	no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
1352.279	1355.914	ellie	okay have you been diagnosed with depression
1356.716	1373.706	participant	 i have had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it was not anything real too debilitating and i was not able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
1375.293	1376.743	ellie	do you feel like therapy is useful
1377.236	1400.936	participant	i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my my marriage over the course of my life now i think it is very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it is a useful tool if you are open to it
1401.865	1403.215	ellie	what got you to seek help
1404.141	1425.241	participant	oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it is good talking things out with a a professional even though i would not see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who is older than i am a little more life experience than someone who is maybe younger
