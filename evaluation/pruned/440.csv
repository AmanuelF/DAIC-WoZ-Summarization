523.9730000000002	525.133	ellie	can you tell me about that
527.68	633.87	participant	 well it came it spawned from from a client of my husband is who is a female and she shared with him that she would been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i have been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating and i we have had this conversation a lot of times and i mean not just that but i do not know just about cheating in general and so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i have not cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and but it was just a mere thought and and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we are having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that is cheating and so that is how that that went into that argent i mean it was not ayelling yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting
