531.9	540.22	participant	 well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he is passed away but he was a psychiatrist 
541.11	542.36	ellie	what were your symptoms 
543.11	574.32	participant	 well i was not sleeping i was laying around the house i was waking up at noon something like and i did not have a focus like for getting a job it was not clear enough i i remember some job interviews that i would go to their front door and then i would not go in and i think that was all all part of depression 
575.36	578.69	ellie	yeah did you think you had a problem before you found out 
579.95	582.57	participant	yeah i thought i had a problem but i did not know what it was

588.88	589.68	ellie	why did you stop 
590.74	613.07	participant	 well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that i was done but and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what is going on with depression so i think i i will have good days and bad days 
613.75	616.72	ellie	what sort of changes have you noticed since you have been going to therapy
619.49	657.76	participant	 i think therapy makes you see what the like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you do not really you see everything through that so you have to kinda i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that 
655.73	663.05	ellie	that makes sense how have you been feeling lately 
664.26	692.96	participant	i think i am slipping back a little bit i do not do well during unemployed periods i have noticed in my path in my past and right now we have a work slow down so it is easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it 
692.63	693.03	ellie	yeah 
693.45	702.97	participant	it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who is tends to be depressed 
703.73	708.33	ellie	 h have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
709.13	759.78	participant	 well i do not know if it is changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let is say but it is more negative like i have have been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past i do not know why but like the in during the roman era era or the greeks ancient greeks how it would have been like to be in a in a frontline battle with you know just crude kind of crude in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and the i do not know i seem my mind seems to go there a lot where i am just thinking about that and i have been looking looking at it and reading books about that or video clips on youtube and
754.5	754.85	ellie	yeah 
760.96	776.45	participant	eh things like that or some other things other kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that where probably should not dwell so much on that 
774.99	781.1	ellie	okay yeah is there anything you regret 
783.01	808.0	participant	oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was was going into depression right then and was not coping in my senior year very well and did not really i did not get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but so that is very that is a big regret that i have
808.9	812.96	ellie	h what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
813.93	852.42	participant	 i think it would have been to at certain points i probably should have sought sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to meet at away locations i think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time
853.27	853.59	ellie	 h 
853.89	854.23	participant	so
