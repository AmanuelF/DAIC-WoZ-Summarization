399.825	423.07	participant	 when when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my verbal gloves up i managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was not my most graceful moment
424.056	429.972	ellie	 oh what is something you feel guilty about
