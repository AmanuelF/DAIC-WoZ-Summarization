152.708	161.235	ellie	that is good that is good do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
161.05	176.38	participant	it depends on the atmosphere if i am around people that i do not feel comfortable with i am kinda reserved but if i am comfortable and i feel like i fit in well i am outgoing

249.7	250.79	participant	oh yes 
252.145	253.305	ellie	can you tell me about that
253.6	283.01	participant	 i have been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i am i am passed that point now but you know when you are young you think you know everything and you know you are never gonna get old and the future does not matter but it does matter because everthing that you do when you are young follows you for the rest of your life and i do not regret things that i have done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices
283.9770000000001	289.129	ellie	yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
288.69	334.28	participant	 me and my wife we we we do not argue we disagree and it is she is very strong willed and she is a match for me so we go back and forth but you know we do not get violent and we do not say meanful things or hurt each other we are just she is a determined strong willed woman and i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argent because in the long run it is just her and me and there is nobody else more important to me
335.022	342.059	ellie	yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
344.1	399.94	participant	 when i was younger i wish that i did not follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my coon sense and that is what got me into trouble i was an only child and i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and getting the girls to laugh or having people think i was you know cool or whatever you would not think that now i am kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and if i would have had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble
400.751	406.511	ellie	 h tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
411.01	464.18	participant	hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed and doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down and he is gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that but as i said i am getting over it and things are getting better slowly
466.7480000000001	472.279	ellie	okay who is someone that is been a positive influence in your life
473.52	515.19	participant	my wife she is always there for me she will always surprise me we she is not my wife she is my best friend and she knows me better than i know myself we enjoy doing simple things it is not that we can not do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other is company we like the same things and we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we we just enjoy each other is company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and it surprises me sometimes

748.939	750.3789999999998	ellie	do you still go to therapy now
750.65	793.62	participant	 well well you know it is not really therapy it is you know every few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it is you know it it is you know kinda like the next person next person it it is i i am with kaiser so it is it is they will talk to you but it they give you the impression that you know i i okay let is move along you know they they will they will hear your explanation but you know it it they do not have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i am doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me
794.449	798.935	ellie	okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy
800.18	850.41	participant	 last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i am always happy when i am doing something with me and my wife and we are enjoying each other and i you know i am not trying to sound like she is my whole world and i do not have anything else she is my world but i i i enjoy being with her and we are we we do things together and i i i am happy all the time when when we are doing that when i am outside of that circle i i i do not know if this sounds right but i am not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i am content i am not i i am not disappointed or i am not wanting anything i am you know whatever comes my way is fine so
851.1210000000002	854.862	ellie	that makes sense how would your best friend describe you
857.88	921.2	participant	well i do not know i i could not give you that answer well my best friend is my wife but she would describe me as i do not think before i speak i let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it is like i let it go and she is bewildered by that years and years ago she i had a classic pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world cause that was my baby and i you know hey do not worry we will get it fixed and she was she thought that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby
918.066	918.866	ellie	 laughter
921.76	942.72	participant	and she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you have put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it is like you do not care so that is the only way i can explain it
943.762	948.833	ellie	 what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
952.45	1024.96	participant	well i i need to lose some weight as you can see i am definitely been on an eating binge and the neurologist said that is probably due to the event with my uncle i am heavy i am this is the heaviest i have ever been in my life and i am finding it a little bit harder i i can not say harder but i am i am finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a scrubbedentry boy you know look at that wonder what is inside there you know that that is we do not do that no more i guess it is we are a little bit older now and a little bit heavier it is harder to walk with all this weight but i i i i wish i could change that because i i you know it is just not healthy the size 
1025.816	1028.928	ellie	okay is there anything you regret
1030.72	1065.33	participant	 lately no i do not regret anything lately everything is been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and i will never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does 
1066.557	1069.507	ellie	what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1070.86	1126.01	participant	do not listen to other people again i am not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they are invincible and so did i i figured ah i am never gonna i am never gonna have those problems i wish i could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i am able to do i do not miss them but if i could go back ten or twenty years i definitely would not make some of the decisions that i made
