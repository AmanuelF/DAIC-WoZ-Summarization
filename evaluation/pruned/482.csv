392.34	434.62	participant	 i think i have gotten better at it there have been times when you know i will i will get angry and you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and i am the type of person that it takes me usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but i have i have learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger in does not it does not attack the other person or the thing that i am angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it it is not a it is not a good behavior to
431.80800000000005	432.198	ellie	right
435.49	454.59	participant	to keep so when when things anger me i try to like talk to the other person say you know this this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem
455.306	458.356	ellie	when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
458.97	515.64	participant	 well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but had not really in in my eyes had not expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she you know i i did not meet em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and
515.3580000000002	515.888	ellie	yeah
516.37	526.6	participant	and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
528.104	529.644	ellie	how did you feel in that moment
531.12	535.46	participant	 are you asking the moment of during the conflict
535.901	536.371	ellie	yeah
536.85	553.59	participant	 very you know just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that i felt was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
552.702	553.172	ellie	
554.27	560.22	participant	so i would think yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
561.132	566.721	ellie	okay tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
567.31	647.06	participant	 h h h i guess it was deciding to go to go to our training last year i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue my wife did not feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife was not supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished relinquished it and i and i said to her you know i am not gonna make you go you know if if you wanna go then then we will go but if not then we will we will do something else we will we will look at at doing something else and not going and so that that was difficult for me cause you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss cause i felt deeply that that is what i was supposed to do but then after i kinda gave that up then then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so so just kinda giving it up was was was difficult for me
