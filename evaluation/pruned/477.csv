start_time	stop_time	speaker	value
232.115	233.055	ellie	how hard is that
233.94	260.74	participant	 i would say it it it is fairly hard in the sense that you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it is also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult too
261.078	267.83	ellie	yeah do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
266.5	269.4	participant	 i am definitely on the shyer side i am an introvert so
270.155	270.725	ellie	why
271.56	300.38	participant	 i am pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people i am very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i am not as engaged and i think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they are not introverted so i i would say and it is also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers
302.151	305.849	ellie	okay how are you at controlling your temper
306.38	312.9	participant	 pretty good i think but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
313.599	315.079	ellie	has that gotten you in trouble
316.75	321.21	participant	not really it can be a challenge when i am driving but other than that no
378.923	384.857	ellie	that is good tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
385.46	421.19	participant	 well let me think about that for a minute h i am having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i am sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind h
423.899	425.519	ellie	let is come back to that later
424.78	426.26	participant	okay i am sorry 
428.196	432.332	ellie	tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
433.61	501.37	participant	h well this is not exactly an event it is it is a dream and it is not a particularly traatic dream so as far as dreams go but i do have it sometimes probably more often than i would like so i would not be upset if it you know if i did not have it and it is just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but it is usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester have not gone to class taking the exams know i am going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did not i study and attend class the way i should have which actually was not really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it is kinda frustrating and i am not exactly sure why i mean i know why but i do not know what it applies to because it is not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
501.802	504.407	ellie	 are they triggered by something
505.45	509.58	participant	no i do not think so at least not not that i am aware of
510.967	516.234	ellie	okay what is something you feel guilty about
517.06	567.64	participant	 i feel guilty i have a a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew he is eight he is adorable and i when i used to live there when he was younger spent a lot of time with them and since i have been in california and particularly in the last year i have spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back in at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last the last time i would seen them and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each other is company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back so that is that makes me feel bad sometimes
568.5459999999998	574.5790000000002	ellie	i understand tell me about your relationship with your family
574.38	632.93	participant	 well i have a brother i am very close to him he is younger and he is like four four and a half years younger he is married i have a nephew my both of my parents have passed away so it is just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we are not that close with them with most of them on my father is side there is one brother and he is married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother is side there are five four or five other kids most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we are not that close with our extended family so
633.771	637.701	ellie	okay who is someone that is been a positive influence in your life
639.05	707.57	participant	 i would say well i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbedentry when i came out to california i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so we worked on a program together over the ser and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she is kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she is moved to vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we are going to napa this weekend so that should be good but she is been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and did not really know anybody and it you know since i am an introvert it is not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it is a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that is been nice
707.9989999999998	713.8389999999998	ellie	that is so good to hear how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep
714.39	751.925	participant	i am a sleeper so it is pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long i have been awake i can be wound a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but i usually meditate right before i go to bed and that is very helpful and i can sleep you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles so you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination i usually do not wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i do not remember it so
751.8589999999998	755.841	ellie	 h what are you like when you do not sleep well
757.14	800.79	participant	 well i do not actually do not sleep very well when i travel one of the things i do for work is i travel quite a bit because i work for a company that is back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i will take the red eye and then i will visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i do not sleep that much it is not that i sleep poorly or badly it is just that i do not have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good so i get a lot more tired and it is harder to concentrate and i do not know it just feels like more of a struggle
802.373	805.4830000000002	ellie	okay how have you been feeling lately
806.65	822.94	participant	i would say good ser is a little is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i am a little i i do not know know if stressed is the right word but i am you know a little anxious about everything going well this ser but in general i am feeling pretty good
824.408	827.578	ellie	have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
830.6	864.48	participant	not really i can not i can not think of anything there there is one thing i i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot and i hike with friends and i had been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then i went away to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated because i did not really exercise when i was there and i would gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i am struggling to try and get back in the routine and it is not going as well as i would like
866.3510000000001	867.091	ellie	i am sorry
867.03	868.5	participant	it is okay thank you
869.549	871.5889999999998	ellie	have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd
871.96	872.21	participant	no
873.1080000000002	874.918	ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
875.35	875.67	participant	no
876.462	879.0089999999999	ellie	tell me about the last time you felt really happy
879.5	900.53	participant	h well scrubbedentry he is a lot of fun and he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and we are actually doing a book club now so we are gonna skype and maybe i will get some more time with him that way but just being around him is fun
902.513	904.203	ellie	how would your best friend describe you
904.87	933.77	participant	h well she would probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious and that i you know care about others and that i am loyal and i am not sure what else i think those those are probably the main things
934.268	939.728	ellie	okay what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
939.51	975.05	participant	 i wish i had more self discipline so i wish that you know i could diet or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i have gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging and i wish that i xxx i do not know i think i wish that i was in a relationship so probably those things
975.942	982.827	ellie	okay tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself
981.7	1046.01	participant	 h so at the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i do not feel like she was i do not think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so i thought and so one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she did not have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it was not i i have been a manager for many years and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with people with staff members
1046.108	1046.638	ellie	yeah
1046.57	1084.51	participant	and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel you know incompetent or at least that is the the way that i felt about it and i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it but after that our relationship was not really the same and i ended up staying leaving there to go back to the old organization that i would worked for not that long afterwards because i just did not really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interaction so
1082.985	1090.736	ellie	yeah i see what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1091.96	1140.7	participant	 so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here is this beautiful coat it is a hundred dollars i want it i am gonna buy it it do not think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that is effectively what your money could do if you did not spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and i think i have been much more a conser than a saver and so i wish that i had been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
