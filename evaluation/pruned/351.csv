240.52	241.43	ellie	how hard is that
241.98	256.2	participant	 it is pretty hard i rather the person notice that i am kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it is like it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
257.47	263.24	ellie	yeah i understand what is one of your most memorable experiences
263.38	270.09	participant	 probably spending time with my family in new york

369.83	383.91	participant	 i just felt the therapist was not really helping me i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she was not really challenging me and i have been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
387.97	389.3	ellie	do you feel like therapy is useful

405.28	408.06	ellie	what sort of changes have you noticed since you have been going to therapy
408.79	442.06	participant	 i am better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is when i am in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it is nice to talk to someone that is not judging that does not really tell me like you know they tell me it is o okay basically 
443.27	446.67	ellie	that is good what were your symptoms
447.27	466.87	participant	 feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda cry about life
