69.8	71.17	participant	i was born in canada
72.064	72.654	ellie	really
72.11	80.9	participant	and but i have lived in california most of my life so and it is grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda you know sluggish
76.535	77.615	ellie	when did you move to la
81.44	82.18	participant	the 
82.61200000000002	84.98700000000002	ellie	yeah when did you move to la
85.66	87.64	participant	oh my gosh years and years ago
89.42	91.32	ellie	how often do you go back to your hometown
91.35	96.17	participant	 not at all i do not think i have gone back there for a long time
95.599	96.169	ellie	why
96.87	107.75	participant	well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it is a fun thing to do it is cost prohibitive so
109.637	110.107	ellie	yeah
110.56	111.01	participant	 h
111.763	113.383	ellie	how does it compare to la
114.63	138.54	participant	oh let is see everything has plus and minuses cold weather not as much sun so i think i would prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that it is it is very pretty back there natural scenery and but i like it here and you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that is a small thing to deal with so
154.6	157.07	ellie	how easy was it for you to get used to living in la
157.86	159.84	participant	easy very easy so
161.131	161.77100000000004	ellie	that is good
161.88	162.19	participant	 h
163.114	164.25400000000005	ellie	what did you study at school
165.3	183.66	participant	 well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it is they have designated courses and then after that went to college and i was a business major let is see i was a veterinary major and i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so
184.219	185.649	ellie	what made you decide to do that
186.37	190.59	participant	 i do not know can not really pinpoint why 
191.648	192.108	ellie	okay
191.93	192.18	participant	so
519.799	520.679	ellie	oh no
520.66	556.88	participant	yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i have only been getting ooh i would say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too cause sometimes they will kind of around two or three in the morning they will either walk around or i will hear something so i am not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it is definitely but there is not like i said there is things you can not control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady is very quiet it is just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers washing clothes at night that is i can not say anything to her about that
557.307	558.1469999999998	ellie	that sucks
557.56	578.63	participant	so yeah but you know there is people that are in worse situations so i do not make a lot out of it you know and i just it is not like every night but it is you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping in another room but for now you know that is i will deal with it so
579.095	580.875	ellie	what are you like when you do not sleep well
581.85	607.51	participant	tired very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cause i do not have my energy also i have not been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather is been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know i am not as motivated when the weather is kinda blah so it is a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
607.894	608.364	ellie	 h
608.44	608.7	participant	
610.529	611.909	ellie	how have you been feeling lately
613.09	630.68	participant	 as i said before tired i am i it is a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we are have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun does not come out that much so i am not getting my serotonin i need that
630.113	630.503	ellie	right
631.09	651.16	participant	i i am not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that is kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i am kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so
651.6	655.46	ellie	okay have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd
655.83	656.8	participant	no 
657.175	658.985	ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
659.06	659.51	participant	no
661.563	665.308	ellie	tell me about the last time you felt really happy
665.46	675.62	participant	i am i am happy most of the time i am a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so
676.551	679.801	ellie	tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
680.6	693.86	participant	h can not think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there is nothing that stands out more than anything else so
