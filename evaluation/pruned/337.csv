start_time	stop_time	speaker	value
488.57	490.68	ellie	what are some things that make you really mad
492.88	517.75	participant	 things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can not fight back and they are mean to them just because they can not fight back and i actually like to see people who are strong as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
518.36	518.7	ellie	yeah
518.6	533.05	participant	or what have you so i think that is one thing that is makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people for people who can not fight back or for people who have done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad
531.52	537.15	ellie	 h okay what do you do when you are annoyed
538.97	571.44	participant	when i am annoyed i will try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i will wind up lashing out somehow either you know verbally just cutting em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i will try to you know if i will try to walk away and defuse it if that does not work then i will let them know that they are annoying me and get away from me that usually works 
570.16	571.67	ellie	has that gotten you in trouble
572.89	604.01	participant	not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i will find a way to get them to leave me alone so there is not really like big trouble but cause i think cause it is it it is off putting and it is not expected the expected reaction and that is actually kind of cultivated in me that it is not the expected reaction cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it is not really in trouble and if 
595.34	595.69	ellie	 h
604.98	619.86	participant	it is is trouble it is usually trouble that it is from their the other person is perspective and it does not affect me at all because it is usually a situation i can get out of so as long as they leave me alone you know i do not i i will walk away from it
667.67	668.04	ellie	yeah
672.08	689.47	participant	and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is cause she can not see that there is inherent danger now because of the disease process 
690.09	690.41	ellie	yeah
690.45	742.79	participant	but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants cause he is a mama is boy like i am i am a mama is girl even though i have lost my mom like four years ago i am still a mama is girl and i will still and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that is what they want so you wanna get it for em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it is kinda dangerous for her you know and i do not want things something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
743.42	743.82	ellie	yeah
743.42	781.18	participant	and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves cause it is not that bad but it is getting where she really should not has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
774.89	775.22	ellie	 h
782.48	803.05	participant	so i mean it is a partnership it is a it is a dual effort it is very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that is like a source of it is not really like yelling screaming argent but lively discussion you know than debate
802.06	805.99	ellie	i see that sounds really hard
807.28	824.69	participant	meh it is not insurmountable i mean life is not gonna be easy ever and if it is that is when you should worry because that is when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you are on top of things and you are present in your life it is not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on
825.7	829.96	ellie	yeah who is someone that is been a positive influence in your life
831.04	862.89	participant	 the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment to myself but they but they helped me see that it is just in me and it is not something i can not get over
863.67	863.99	ellie	 h
863.74	877.4	participant	and that you know life is gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you are forty you are forty whether you are working at mcdonald is or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i have lived my life since she is passed 
878.96	883.38	ellie	that is great is there anything you regret
886.04	905.71	participant	i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother is life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i did not take care of that when she was the last year of her life cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home
904.7	905.06	ellie	yeah
906.66	957.57	participant	so i did not eat right i did not take my insulin right i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick and i am wondering well if i did not if i would have taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision my vision and my thoughts were not completely were not clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she wound up having a health catastrophe cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having
956.6	957.02	ellie	wow
958.52	993.48	participant	sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i am thinking well if i did not if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there was not anything i would have been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that is like one huge regret that i have
994.28	997.77	ellie	yeah do you think that maybe you are being a little hard on yourself
998.7	1058.26	participant	oh i know i am but xxx it is my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can not really direct them into my own vision because they are their own individual beings and they can not you know be what i want them to be and i know they are not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know cause they are other beings and i know i am not gonna be able to do that for them and they are not gonna be able to do that for me but it is still my ideals so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
1056.14	1056.54	ellie	
1058.71	1070.92	participant	is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what is their is it their decision or mine and it is usually it is theirs and i know it is theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you are just gonna support them and go with them but 
1154.02	1154.4	ellie	
1157.02	1158.58	participant	ten years ago 
1158.72	1161.75	ellie	okay have you ever served in the military
1162.22	1162.54	participant	no
1163.22	1165.11	ellie	have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd
1165.61	1165.91	participant	no
1166.6	1168.39	ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
1169.12	1192.13	participant	no but probably cause i have not gone to a doctor about it cause i do not wanna know and i mean it is not i know there have been times in my life where i have been severely depressed and it is usually circstances and had to pull myself out of it but i would rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets 
1191.57	1192.84	ellie	can you give me an example of that
1194.1	1260.61	participant	 after my mother had died i mean it would been this long battle for a year that we lost and i did not know if i if i was to blame for that it is like logically i knew i was not but how could i convince myself of that two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i did not take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i am thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no turns out no but i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that it is been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression cause so much of my life was based on being my mother is daughter all of a sudden i did not it is like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
1259.82	1260.23	ellie	yeah
1261.36	1319.29	participant	that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression i almost got divorced because of it because i just did not want anything anymore so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it is been a fight you know you mean there times when no i could not get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they do not have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
1319.62	1319.96	ellie	 h
1320.52	1336.65	participant	i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they did not have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they could not
1337.48	1337.95	ellie	yeah
1337.56	1377.28	participant	they did not you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i did not want to did not just did not just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would have been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i was not there to take care of them they would have been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably and maybe they would have not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for for me i mean for me making selfish decisions 
1374.04	1374.42	ellie	
1378.03	1406.03	participant	so it is like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed so and that is actually been a motivating factor is to to cause i have figured out that if it was just me i would be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it would not be a big deal i would not care as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now so i have to go out and do things 
1406.49	1406.89	ellie	yeah
1406.65	1421.88	participant	you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know but i am trying to strike a balance between the two because it is what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i am been working on on a balance of the two
1422.5	1423.44	ellie	how hard is that 
1425.0	1454.18	participant	very but it is worth it i mean it would be very i would have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that it is it is difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
1454.8	1455.27	ellie	yeah
1455.38	1485.5	participant	and i and and i know that but it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up but then it is like well what is the alternative i mean i do not think i could live a comfortable life cause if i did i would not do anything i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i am not gonna do anything with myself i am just gonna be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever and i would not get anything done 
1486.6	1489.72	ellie	i see how have you been feeling lately 
1490.94	1553.66	participant	 very anxious and nervous and i mean what if i do not find enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if you know what what if i can not keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it is actually hard work to be stable and i know it is hard work to be stable but what you know it is just eh a lot of what ifs and and i do not think it is things that have not happened and it is stupid and pointless to worry about things that have not happened and i know that but it still happens it still creeps in so that is actually a source of anxiety but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it but i i i know it it is a cycle
1552.65	1553.19	ellie	that is good 
1554.34	1574.15	participant	and i will go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here i mean what what is just extraneous and what can what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
1574.62	1575.07	ellie	
1575.13	1602.11	participant	and so figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again i will have to figure it out again but i know it is a cycle i know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
1602.79	1607.48	ellie	yes when was the last time you felt really happy 
1609.02	1652.78	participant	the last time i felt really happy i do not know zz i h that is a good question that actually that actually surprisingly stped me because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle really like overjoyously happy i do not know i i am not i can not think of of when that happened
1655.22	1659.46	ellie	okay how would your best friend describe you 
1663.93	1688.12	participant	i do not know you do not know perceptions of other people i mean probably as somebody who oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know handles things as they come but i do not see myself as that at all and it is a it
1687.85	1690.19	ellie	what would you say are some of your best qualities 
1691.83	1715.72	participant	probably that i can think on my feet and i am not afraid to hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done that and i can do it creatively and i try to strive for balance probably probably the best things about me 
1716.57	1721.92	ellie	 h that is great what are you most proud of in your life 
1723.6	1759.27	participant	that i am doing basically what i want with my life which even though it is not all easy it is not you know i am not financially well off or anything it is still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives cause i have an aunt that i really do not talk to who and the reason why i do not talk to her is because she is always miserable i mean she is got a career that she it is more of a job that she fell into cause my older aunt loves animals but did not wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer 
1753.04	1753.43	ellie	 h
1759.71	1783.98	participant	and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time but her hands you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had the actually my cousin is father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business and she kinda she retired early cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early 
1779.33	1779.84	ellie	 oh 
1784.46	1793.28	participant	she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it and it is like change your life if you hate your life so much change it 
1793.93	1794.41	ellie	yeah
1794.6	1824.21	participant	and the thing the thing i am most proud of is yeah i am not as financially well off as she is but i am doing what i want with my life you know i can be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me people i actually like in my life and be happy with that and i see a lot of people who are not and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i am not like that 
1825.11	1825.47	ellie	yeah 
1825.11	1831.98	participant	and i am actually doing what i want even though there is sacrifices i am still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
1832.53	1839.18	ellie	 that is so good to hear okay i think i have asked everything i need to 
1837.33	1840.46	participant	thank you okay
