629.572	652.09	participant	well on the myers briggs personality test i am i am an extrovert but lately like since moving but i am not like i am not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion or on the scale of extroversion sorry i would consider myself extremely introverted 
651.66	652.23	ellie	why
653.7090000000002	674.335	participant	i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they are around they are able to like strike up conversations and i am i am a fairly shy person i am sort of like or inhibited person maybe so i like to like until yeah i am but i am working on it i am working on it
675.0169999999998	689.24	ellie	okay sometimes when i am feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it is not hawaii but it is the best i have got what do you do to relax
691.363	725.07	participant	 well in the past i would smoke weed but i have quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie i do not have or maybe go like depending if it is like an xxx if it is if it is a worn out sort of stress like i am just like then i that is what i do but if it is a more like anxious type stress i might go on a an intense walk do not really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking
725.904	729.3560000000001	ellie	yeah how are you at controlling your temper
731.19	731.6110000000001	participant	pretty good
733.1110000000001	736.1610000000002	ellie	when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
736.571	763.69	participant	well i always like arguing i would not call arguing necessarily losing my temper i i enjoy a vicious debate but i do not as long as my like cause i will not like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my argents i try to keep it on subject
833.5360000000002	838.191	ellie	why yes
838.654	926.78	participant	 they think that like there is some there is some sort of they will as i understand it they have they have a certain they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there is a whole like complexity of character within the movie and that somehow like what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it is like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there is this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and like personally i it is not like a bad movie or anything but it is the i just do not think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
922.979	923.449	ellie	
927.43	954.55	participant	in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it there is nothing bad about the movie there is nothing articulable like articulable about that is it is like solid good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool the eh it really you know it is cool it is but but it is meaningless for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
954.664	955.194	ellie	yeah
954.82	975.25	participant	and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained you have django and django is like a kinda he is a two dimensional character but i do not think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is
975.403	975.793	ellie	right
975.73	1021.48	participant	and and you have doctor king schultz who is this who is this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there is no way he would have risked his life to save django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this plantation to to save django is wife etcetera and and the reason the the reason for her giving that argent which like either you buy that he would do that or he would not but the reason for her argent is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else
1021.539	1022.269	ellie	h
1022.06	1068.0410000000004	participant	 which strikes which strikes me as so like like who like she she her basic her basic argent was that altruism like altruism does not exist it was a very ayn rand type argent altruism does not exist the only the only thing you can do is serve like the only thing people do is serve themself so it is not quite ayn rand but it is like the only people thing that people like all people are out to serve themself which i am not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there is maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self interest was the only motivating factor
1068.311	1068.781	ellie	yeah
1068.45	1128.88	participant	in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that is like what your ultimate purpose like if you if you can not like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah and it is it so so yeah that that i guess that is the the i do not think i necessarily like lost my temper i think of losing my temper as being more like i just so i i would so revert to ad hominem like attacks but i i did not like that is not maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing like criticizing her world view but it i was not like well you are an idiot you know like it was not it did not it did not turn into abuse of any sort
1219.972	1220.482	ellie	
1227.99	1273.82	participant	and but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i did not i was either gonna live with people who i was not as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two which was not which did not end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york
1274.145	1277.619	ellie	i see how hard is that
1280.3	1283.7	participant	it was how hard was that or how hard is
1283.224	1283.844	ellie	yes
1284.62	1338.65	participant	how hard was that it was hard it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating cause also like i would fallen like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i was not on speaking terms with her and i could not like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more closer to xxx her it was was not quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i did not like you know just being socially isolated etcetera
1338.9979999999996	1341.6	ellie	yeah that sucks
1342.54	1342.85	participant	yeah
1343.892	1346.332	ellie	how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep
1347.29	1385.79	participant	well recently it is been awful i i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like could not fall asleep for whatever reason it is too much riled up energy or something i i do not know
1387.364	1390.779	ellie	 what are you like when you do not sleep well
1392.38	1429.87	participant	tired very not iediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i have had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i had not had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so i guess with with caffeine in my system i am ready to i am ready to go without caffeine it is i am just i am just quieter i guess
1430.685	1431.145	ellie	okay
1430.91	1431.76	participant	more introverted
1432.948	1436.118	ellie	have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
1437.99	1440.695	participant	since like lately as in when
1441.862	1443.062	ellie	whatever comes to your mind
1445.19	1509.39	participant	 change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx cause i moved here cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i do not have like a a large nber of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty overwhelming at first and i think that i am slowly like coming to terms with that and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily you know like it is still it is still there the pressure is there but i am just you know you you know you know 
1506.344	1513.081	ellie	that is good have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd
1513.57	1515.13	participant	no i just

1519.124	1522.8470000000002	ellie	tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1527.68	1606.31	participant	the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back i think the last time i felt really happy was during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie co wrote co directed co produced and that was kinda like that it still conses my life but but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full energy between between me and the person writing it and and there is like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it is just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess it is hard to hard to think that i have not been really truly happy since then but when you are making a movie like
1600.776	1601.346	ellie	wow
1607.29	1615.57	participant	you do not you can not allow yourself to be happy really especially if you are doing it you know basically by yourself with with like xxx like can not
1609.918	1610.388	ellie	 h
