478.65	521.17	participant	 i am trying to think here i can not recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i had a creditor that i was dealing with being very difficult to work with and i owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and they were not very understanding of the situation and i i really got a little upset about that because i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing hardball and i did not care for that
521.73	526.0930000000002	ellie	yeah that sucks
