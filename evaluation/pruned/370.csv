87.95	114.36	participant	 well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking camping is pretty close by i have gone snowboarding i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it is it is a big city and you know i am pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too
115.048	118.899	ellie	cool what are some things you do not really like about la
119.0	141.57	participant	 probably the nber one thing that everybody says i do not like traffic i do not like being stuck in traffic i do not like the long coutes even you know for short distances and then you know it gets really hot in the ser at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that is fine
142.261	151.185	ellie	 h i love my job you could almost say it is virtually made for me what is your dream job
152.42	186.27	participant	wow my dream job that is a great question i i think my dream job would probably be you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that is almost an unrealistic dream since i do not know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
263.04400000000004	263.574	ellie	yeah
263.21	308.74	participant	so i got to see you know my family is old you know hometown you know we have a family like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that you know seeing my parents old friends you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i do not know if it was for everyone you know i do not know if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
309.493	325.262	ellie	awesome sometimes when i am feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it is not hawaii but it is the best i have got what do you do to relax
327.12	385.35	participant	 that is that is a good question i do i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that is on so i will i will turn that on you know just kind of zone out a little bit to you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or maybe like eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but like in n out i really like going there so if i have to unwind you know it is once every few months maybe i will do that or i really like to read especially like i will read the day is events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it is reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i will read the headlines and i really like to know what is going on that kind of centers me so i i really enjoy that that is something i do to relax
385.857	390.854	ellie	 h how are you at controlling your temper
393.06	416.81	participant	i would say i am pretty great at it although i do not i think my nature makes it pretty easy makes that pretty easy i do not i do not get very upset upset easily at all so i it is not much of a challenge to control my temper eh yeah i do not i do not really have anger issues i it is it is difficult for me to get angry so i do not i do not i do not really have much trouble with that at all
417.593	420.643	ellie	when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
423.62	457.62	participant	the last time i argued with somebody was probably i do not even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might have had with family or friends about things but just a full on argent i i i i can not even remember it is been years i i do not really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i do not really see anything to be gained by and i kind of naturally repel away from it so i do not sorry i do not i do not have much to say about arguing
458.124	463.956	ellie	okay what is something you feel guilty about
465.94	516.38	participant	something i feel guilty about i would say that you know sometimes i eh sometimes i do not really i feel like i maybe have not made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot i i feel like i there is always more opportunities out there that that we are missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there is always something that i could be doing that i am not even if it is just putting away the laundry that that is been i took out of the dryer that is been sitting there or running late i really do not like running late although it happens more than i would like to i would and i do not know why i feel guilty about that i do not like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
662.03	666.27	ellie	yeah how have you been feeling lately
668.05	687.45	participant	i have been pretty feeling pretty good i i have been i have no complaints physically and you know health wise i feel good you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints as far as how i am feeling about myself or anything like that
689.074	692.2439999999998	ellie	have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
694.24	709.85	participant	no no i have been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traatic nothing kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening
710.288	714.201	ellie	okay have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd
714.56	714.88	participant	no
715.448	717.258	ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
717.56	717.98	participant	no
719.255	720.325	ellie	is there anything you regret
722.6	755.02	participant	well i think there is plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there is there is plenty of things in my life yeah like i said i i do regret you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there is a period of time in my early twenties where i i did not work for a while i just i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just you know we we got high every day or it seemed like every day i do not know it was just eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw away period in my life
756.7689999999999	759.7189999999998	ellie	what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
763.3	822.58	participant	i would say that it is important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it is also i would say that it is important to recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that i would say also that kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there is a bit of lost time with that that approach it is kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule and life is not a race but i would say that it was it is important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and thinking that things will fall into place
822.926	831.529	ellie	 that makes sense tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself
835.46	878.5	participant	 well i i i guess when people i i do not especially take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i am sure i am wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like group work that i have done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i do not i do not deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
879.451	880.9910000000001	ellie	when was the last time that happened
883.04	958.24	participant	 it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and somebody with much less experience it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of college you know went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just i i did not think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work or or even to not not to redo it but to to edit it or to not eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i should not have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it was not our call 
957.905	962.209	ellie	yeah what is one of your most memorable experiences
966.64	1012.86	participant	 most memorable experiences well i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my the first real trip i took by myself i i took the the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things for about ten days on my own so that was kind of the longest period of time up notil that point and i was in my i was i do not know twenty three maybe at the time that i i would really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really you know exposed to the things i would not have seen if i had had traveling companions and it was a lot of fun
1013.628	1019.247	ellie	nice tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1020.89	1035.15	participant	 well i have been very happy recently i for the i i am getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day in two thousand twelve thanks so i i was that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of of meeting someone and we
