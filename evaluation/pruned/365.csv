1029.96	1076.425	participant	because she put me through so much crap in my life and i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there is only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would have left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would have got out sooner i do not know i would have been happier i guess
1077.216	1081.823	ellie	i see what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1086.2	1147.29	participant	 it is okay to be selfish it is okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you are not thinking about yourself you are not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that is you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it is okay
