252.091	264.463	ellie	 that is good do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
264.29	290.125	participant	i am more shy but i am forced to be outgoing because i you know you can not really get anything done being shy but given a choice i would rather be you know a little more pulled back until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think
290.18	293.7	ellie	i understand can you give me an example of that
294.89	302.815	participant	an example h well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect

307.965	348.157	participant	okay well example like traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and it is something great happening there even though it is a great place but it is not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there you know to do you know xxx you know have a great time you know i think it is because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know
