562.566	565.617	ellie	when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
567.07	581.28	participant	 last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the la times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so
581.559	582.719	ellie	can you tell me about that
584.27	636.2	participant	yeah the the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of it did not show up and i did not realize that it was not there until late i do not know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they could not send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been counicated with me so i was angry with the la times i was angry with the people who would forwarded the newspaper and did not tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated
636.7669999999998	641.87	ellie	yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
642.49	738.52	participant	oh wow there are quite a few of those let me think about one the other day i had a phone call and i am in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with someone who is not my coach and that had not been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and i am like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i do not know so yeah i was not i was not angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but yeah i could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother
739.17	746.061	ellie	 h tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
747.81	798.15	participant	h the hardest decision wow there is been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it was not even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and that was a pretty tough decision cause at that point my family had been you know within an hour is drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
798.9169999999998	800.3489999999998	ellie	what made you decide to do that what made you decide to do that
802.057	855.438	participant	oh lots of things i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there is just a huge outdoor outdoor counity in colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
856.1310000000002	858.012	ellie	that sounds like a great situation that sounds like a great situation
859.7280000000002	860.038	participant	yeah
860.632	863.072	ellie	how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep
864.377	905.208	participant	 that was totally unrelated question relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i am out and i do not get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i have had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily
905.913	907.293	ellie	are they triggered by something
909.236	940.489	participant	 yeah i am sure they are i mean i am in another transition state i am moving out of out of the house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it is and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she is exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah
940.897	941.838	ellie	how hard is that how hard is that
943.051	954.61	participant	 living with her is pretty hard like it is probably the hardest thing i have ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i do not think i would have said yes to the situation
955.564	959.44	ellie	i see how have you been feeling lately how have you been feeling lately
960.802	983.992	participant	 i feel trapped and helpless like there is you know nothing i can there is no way out of the situation that i am in no matter what i do it does not get any better i do not i do not i know i am not getting any kind of work that i want to do and my money is not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy
985.202	985.943	ellie	i am sorry i am sorry

1017.54	1018.192	ellie	why did you stop why did you stop
1020.205	1049.352	participant	 well i originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and and then i began therapy again later on think i was it was in my early thirties and then i we ended that because i would moved to ireland so
1050.633	1052.085	ellie	do you feel like therapy is useful do you feel like therapy is useful
1053.333	1063.083	participant	yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i do not go into therapy thinking oh i am gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that is ridiculous
1063.33	1063.72	ellie	right
1064.093	1094.373	participant	i think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can not see and you know work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you do not have to be in therapy forever
