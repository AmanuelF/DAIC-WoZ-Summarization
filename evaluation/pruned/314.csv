248.78	253.645	ellie	nice what are some things that make you really mad
254.8	295.925	participant	 really mad probably not a lot i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but in terms of like really getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who is twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry have not i have not have not felt that
294.095	300.965	ellie	okay what is the best thing about being a parent
301.98	354.03	participant	 contributing to society helping helping to raise responsible people i guess and of course the love and the affection and the the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i am in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it is really fun because we are able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that is going on in the world and you know have have challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it is it is a different level than when you are taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff
354.47	358.04	ellie	 h what is the hardest thing about being a parent
359.135	396.63	participant	the hardest thing is that it is twenty four seven you are never not a parent you know it is and so you have to accept that and that is i remember when i first with my first child thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there is no going back you you cannot change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circstances you can not change that and it is a permanent thing and it it it in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom
405.18	407.59	ellie	who is someone that is been a positive influence in your life
408.65	410.93	participant	i am sorry i did not get what you said
410.4	413.35	ellie	what are some things you like to do for fun who is someone that is been a positive influence in your life 
413.34	445.94	participant	 some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church and my faith but also my husband he is been a really he is kind of he is very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he is always we balance each other out likewise if he is upset about something i am able to balance him out it is been a that is been a a great gift in my life
450.245	452.105	ellie	how are you at controlling your temper
453.18	493.25	participant	 i do not i i do not think i would be categorized as somebody with a a temper occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i do not like have like rarely do i have outbursts i am more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i do not rarely fight like have argents that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i am more of a type of person that counicates on the spot so if i am thinking something i usually counicate it right away instead of letting it build up
494.295	499.21	ellie	that is good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
499.475	530.055	participant	 usually i am arguing with my older son because he you know he thinks he knows everything he is twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality and i am just telling him that he does not know it all and you know as life goes on he will learn more he is very confident and very self self what is the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that is all
530.455	531.805	ellie	that sounds really hard
532.055	534.395	participant	 it is it can be

1328.0870000000002	1329.007	ellie	
1328.092	1346.977	participant	and she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that
1347.0870000000002	1348.067	ellie	oh no
1347.352	1357.5970000000002	participant	my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cause i did not have to go through any of the labor but i am sure they were not happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that
1358.677	1359.1270000000004	ellie	yeah
1358.677	1359.1270000000004	participant	so
1360.987	1364.027	ellie	what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
1366.802	1422.404	participant	now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as relaxed not as like i feel now at my age that i i do not have the same concerns that i did then i do not worry about i do not worry at all about what people think about me i do not worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter is oh mom you can not wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i do not care you know but they do because it is still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
