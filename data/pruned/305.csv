533.905	534.485	ellie	
534.415	556.245	participant	and what it was about was just her lying to me telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know did not like that at all

600.445	600.885	ellie	
600.725	628.475	participant	you know and if you are lying about something well you just you are always having to cover up more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just do not see any you know so it kinda took a lot from me trusting her now or you know whatever now i am i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it is kinda hurt our relationship

847.465	852.915	ellie	i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep
854.155	890.275	participant	 it is been hard lately it is been probably hard for the last going on a year you know i depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i have been looking for work quite a bit so just wondering why you know i do not get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts so or i get depressed you know cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so
890.305	890.995	ellie	yeah
890.885	905.575	participant	i do not lately i just been sleeping a bit too much at least for me because i am so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it is changed to about eight to nine hours and i am still tired

917.245	941.025	participant	 tired i you know if i do not sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i am more of a guy you know i love to work and if i am not then it is just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
941.305	941.915	ellie	
941.915	985.175	participant	and so you know i there i either if i am busy or i am doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it it is something new for me and so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i do not have to worry about you know money you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
985.175	988.065	ellie	 how do you cope with them
988.525	989.445	participant	how do i what
1182.525	1183.965	ellie	do you feel like therapy is useful

1212.455	1213.565	ellie	how hard is that
1214.705	1232.625	participant	 it is tough if you do not you know i do not medicate so i mean i have been on medication before in the past but again it is i try to live on life i try to live life on life is terms and i just you know
1233.205	1233.685	ellie	
1233.215	1303.325	participant	 i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and and what i do not like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i have been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things it is just my life skills you know i i do not i do not wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months and then they go well here i am gonna try you on this and or i am gonna try you on that and it is just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that is it and whether it is different than whether if i would be on on on on meds for it i do not think so you know it is the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
1303.025	1303.635	ellie	yeah
1304.385	1329.425	participant	and i will deal with it you know sometimes it is not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i do not like people i do not like crowds i do not you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so but i i get a person you know i it is not that personality but i think people can see me and just say do not mess with this guy or you know 
1330.495	1331.165	ellie	
1330.985	1348.815	participant	but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that is how i deal with with with with people because i just know there is consequences if i if i did not deal with it that way 
1349.235	1349.905	ellie	yeah
1349.535	1357.895	participant	so i just let it go i would rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it is not that bad
