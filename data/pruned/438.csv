143.121	151.684	ellie	i see what you mean i am sure you can tell by my shoes i am not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot
151.89	164.52	participant	i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i have just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere
166.226	169.56599999999997	ellie	that is good what do you enjoy about traveling
171.05	187.25	participant	i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places going particularly somewhere i have never been and learning about that place you know like so if i am going to dc i really look forward to it cause it is a historic city you know things like that
188.253	189.933	ellie	i would love to hear about one of your trips
191.25	235.73	participant	 my most recent trip would have been dc last year i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building i got to see a lot of other different government buildings and it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back
237.149	241.195	ellie	nice what is one of your most memorable experiences
242.37	265.1	participant	 attending my friend is wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and i have been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day
268.151	269.261	ellie	tell me about your kids
270.13	324.93	participant	 i have three sons thirteen year old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he is eight they all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they are just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they are just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty so it is actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty they are teenage years my youngest still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he will be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it is a challenging time for me as well
327.178	328.898	ellie	what is the best thing about being a parent
330.4	387.9	participant	just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know well i can not say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they are going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and it is just it is very rewarding and actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they are older and off in college cause i really love children and giving back
388.732	395.421	ellie	aw that is so good to hear what is the hardest thing about being a parent
396.37	462.16	participant	 there is probably a couple of things but i would just say for me being a single parent is the financial well i would say that along with some of the emotional with with them having to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the sometimes when you are just tired you do not wanna be bothered or you are trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice this one want to go over here this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you are able to put food on the table you are paying your rent and you know you are keeping up with the day to day and that is those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with
462.733	465.358	ellie	yeah how do you cope with them
466.46	504.23	participant	well i just i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and i am extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate if i see i need a little help if if you know i am i am i am not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably
505.213	507.622	ellie	 what did you study at school
508.425	521.25	participant	 i studied counications actually i was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i am studying business 
628.5319999999998	635.3009999999998	ellie	 do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
635.44	688.19	participant	 that is actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and not so much shy as i am reserved now but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i am checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i am like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but i am also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk you know i seem like a chatterbox but i am not really so usually if i am in a big space with a whole lot of people i do not like to be the center of attention attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person
688.664	701.7330000000002	ellie	 sometimes when i am feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it is not hawaii but it is the best i have got what do you do to relax
698.01	762.04	participant	 for me it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture if i am able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that
762.855	766.5260000000002	ellie	okay how are you at controlling your temper
767.75	817.1	participant	 pretty good sometimes i am just like grr i do not really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just i am more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable quite agitated especially if it is that time of the month for me i just lose patience outside of that i am actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i am at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if they are a new a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me
818.125	818.595	ellie	
818.14	844.37	participant	 you know with my kids sometimes you know it is this it works both ways too once it is that time of the month i am just like ugh just leave me alone or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i am han and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it
845.054	849.576	ellie	yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
850.56	917.28	participant	 well i have not really had it not per se an argent but there is been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argent but you know i i had some issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept i was not getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you you know i do not know if you would consider that an argent but i would definitely say that is the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that that was the closest you know to an argent and then i had to call back this morning that one did not really escalate to an argent but it was a a a tense exchange for a minute or two
917.988	923.222	ellie	i see tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
924.74	1003.2	participant	probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on saturday with american express or actually it was on sunday yeah and i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you you are constantly being told different things and i have had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so just i kept raising my voice said some things i should not had and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there my blood pressure was raised excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that is one i i definitely wish i could have kept my cool and been more level headed and and not really raised my voice and you know been more polite
1004.243	1009.473	ellie	okay tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
1011.345	1100.15	participant	 well i have probably have had a couple but probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and i was not comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and that is always stayed with me and i have always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could have been i try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would have just i would have kept the baby and moved forward so that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest
1101.431	1102.501	ellie	i am sorry to hear that
1102.96	1103.46	participant	thank you

1112.212	1113.592	ellie	how have you been feeling lately
1114.35	1177.89	participant	 okay you know i was laid off in december so i have been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet so that is been a little tough i have had i have had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i my my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place about five years ago well she is been able to move forward and go on with her life and now she is graduating in next month from usc with her master is in social work so i am feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i have very very happy for her you know and she is a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me
1178.632	1179.582	ellie	i understand
1185.965	1295.38	participant	well i am really good with people i counicate well i like to talk i am really good with children that is why i would like to teach or be a counselor although i have not not really tapped into it i know i am a very creative person i know i write pretty good i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i am very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting fiction writing but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays i am not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i am a great mediator and i know how to because i have been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that is actually graduating from sc but i know i am like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i do not know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i am a pisces but i am i am really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it is something i could go into and develop i would do well
1296.208	1299.455	ellie	 h is there anything you regret
1300.435	1352.23	participant	 not really some of the situations i wish i would have waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children picked a different partner and i say that i mean my son is father is great but a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we are not together we have not been together in years but i am just saying overall i think had i yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and i think that is that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do
1353.203	1356.1529999999998	ellie	what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
