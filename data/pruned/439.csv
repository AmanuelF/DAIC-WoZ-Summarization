231.199	242.965	ellie	sometimes when i am feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it is not hawaii but it is the best i have got what do you do to relax
243.53	276.945	participant	oh i have a favorite thing i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i am a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i have been very successful since i was a kid i have won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh i am so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter em i usually try to enter em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it is been successful for me
533.596	539.501	ellie	yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
540.64	616.99	participant	 it is probably something about my husband did oh he i know what it was it is about well probably over some construction new construction that my husband is working on on our house we had a disagreement on that men have their own way of doing things and i had told him not to use a certain eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he did not listen and so i did not say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that he he would have done wrong and i told him i said look you are losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now cause he knows he has done wrong and but he does not wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he does not wanna really face the fact so he says look it is my project no it is our project so eh that that is one of the biggest argents what we are having right now that i can think of that is recent
617.637	619.177	ellie	how did you feel in that moment
620.31	663.19	participant	i felt that he he he did not really listen to me and he more so looked at a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cause i told him that you need to do your research i am the type of person i do my research before i jp into something i i i try to dot my i is and cross my t is but my husband he is not like that he is like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he is a good friend of mine so i do not care i mean is he licensed he does not look at all that stuff he is he just jps into it 
660.6560000000002	661.046	ellie	right
663.64	674.66	participant	which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
671.054	671.8939999999999	ellie	that sucks
675.15	680.7	participant	it was just wasted money that we could have saved cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
681.595	682.035	ellie	yeah
681.735	683.255	participant	and it did not make any sense
685.315	689.0939999999998	ellie	tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
690.63	780.45	participant	 i retired early i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i would been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i do not know if you are familiar with calpirg but we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long i did not get the full percentage i should have stayed notil i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i did not get the full amount but that is okay eh i i found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis so i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should have kinda waited notil i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i do not i pay very little money so i think that over negates the the money that i receive
780.9910000000001	786.7389999999998	ellie	yeah tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
787.74	870.505	participant	 let me see the hardest it is probably when my mom died cause i am not used to anybody dying and my mother died in ninety nine of non hodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility because i am the eldest it was put in me and i am like oh my god what do i do xxx and so i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but for some unknown reason she did not have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she did not die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
871.383	872.7330000000002	ellie	that sounds really hard
872.5	925.99	participant	yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i this will sound weird but since that i have learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance policy xxx not insurance policy but what do you call the barrel insurance we had that and it just we have had it for many many years so it is almost paid but xxx ten years it will pay for everything the plot and everything and another thing that i did i have even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that is it i do not want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that is the one thing we did agree on
923.361	924.301	ellie	that makes sense
926.53	939.73	participant	and he said he do not want anybody to to have any problem people coming in and telling em what to do it is already written we did a living trust i mean it is nothing they can do but make one phone call
940.407	940.917	ellie	
940.56	941.26	participant	and that is it
943.059	945.499	ellie	how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep

950.209	951.589	ellie	how have you been feeling lately
952.11	965.555	participant	 i have been a little tired but that is only because of physical condition i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it is more physical but not in the mental

987.27	989.817	ellie	tell me about the last time you felt really happy
990.58	1016.505	participant	i am basically happily all the time i am more so i am making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input thanks and then they i will i will follow up on em and see how they are doing
1017.292	1022.442	ellie	that is so good to hear how would your best friend describe you
1023.27	1092.23	participant	oh resource person i have been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i am the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just do not xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information some i know we have the technology here that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i am never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you would be surprised i do not give up my yellow pages so there is certain little things that i do not really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you would be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say i am more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it
1087.222	1087.692	ellie	 h
1093.95	1095.38	participant	and that gives me satisfaction
1094.707	1097.614	ellie	what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
1098.14	1143.35	participant	 i wish i can stop going up and down on my weight i will lose weight i will go on this big diet before the sertime and and then by christmas time i am i have a what they call a yo yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend i think that is just a nervous disorder i just i like to eat and but also i do not like to be overweight either cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can not get em xxx on right now so i know i say if i am gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the sertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it is mostly not happy with my weight that is it yeah

1149.695	1165.65	participant	 no not really i regret that i can not stay skinny i can not lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on
1166.766	1169.716	ellie	what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1171.06	1198.87	participant	 let is see xxx ten or twenty years ago i would have saved a little bit more money before i retired and xxx basically putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early
1198.062	1200.362	ellie	what are you most proud of in your life
1200.65	1252.655	participant	most proudest is of my life meeting a lot of people that came in my life i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we are all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think it is basically keeping the same friends i think eh we are gonna probably outlive each other
