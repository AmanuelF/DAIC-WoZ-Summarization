494.6	518.85	participant	 yeah a long time ago you know i have taken many medications here and there and they really some of em would nb me some of them would make me feel hyper so i have recently decided to in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i do not take anything i barely even take an aspirin just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state

530.18	545.53	participant	always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can not pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and that is what was making me depressed
547.48	553.93	ellie	yeah do you feel like therapy is useful 
555.25	568.3	participant	i do at some point i have had some good therapists and i have had some bad therapists i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen 
568.89	569.27	ellie	
569.32	577.87	participant	and then they just say okay your time is up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i would be better with a psychiatrist psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
699.59	702.88	ellie	 
703.09	713.41	participant	oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that is one of my memorable esperiences 
711.79	715.2	ellie	wow that is great 
715.79	717.33	participant	yeah cause i am an animal lover so 
719.35	721.89	ellie	yeah is there anything you regret 
723.79	740.15	participant	 just the way that i have treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so but when ever since i stopped the drinking i do not do that anymore so 
735.79	736.2	ellie	
741.43	751.37	participant	so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i have let that go cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i was not doing it to be sociable 
741.49	757.32	ellie	that is good yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
759.01	784.47	participant	get in a career that is really stable like eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should have gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money do not go spend it on extravagant things 
785.11	791.08	ellie	yeah that makes sense what are some things that usually put you in a good mood 
793.01	807.23	participant	 when i have a job when i when i am able to work when i am helping other people when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood 
808.17	812.93	ellie	that is great okay i think i have asked everything i need to
813.05	814.41	participant	okay thank you
