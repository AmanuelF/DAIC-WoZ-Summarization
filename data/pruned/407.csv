96.971	99.808	ellie	okay where are you from originally

145.71	147.33	ellie	how does it compare to la
148.28	188.48	participant	 it compares to la it does not really compare to la i i grew up in sacramento actually i did not get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i do not know if i did i forgot anyways yeah there is like nothing really to do there it is really small it is the valley la has all the stuff to do it has oceans and it is by all kinds of located by a lot of cool places like vegas and san diego and what have you not so but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i do not miss like the actual city i just miss some of the people that i grew up with
188.699	196.834	ellie	yeah i am sure you can tell by my shoes i am not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot
197.07	208.27	participant	oh i can not see your shoes but i do not travel a lot actually i have only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i have enough money to do so
209.723	212.668	ellie	okay what did you study at school
213.78	257.41	participant	 well originally i wanted to be a filaker and which i still wanna be a filaker and i studying i was took i took counications and did general ed stuff too and took like video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to filaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i have not really used it since i have been back here in la i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but and then i transferred switched over to be to business which i took some classes in that but now i am actually studying to be an optician and i am actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so
257.21	257.78	ellie	wow
258.69	283.11	participant	but i do wanna be i actually still wanna be a filaker and that is still one of my plans and i still actually i got into playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we will see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere
283.726	285.156	ellie	what made you decide to do that
286.48	287.15	participant	to be an optician
355.412	359.83	ellie	do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
359.19	369.46	participant	 i am definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i am kinda shy right now because talking to you and you are in a computer and you are a cartoon

385.38	438.89	participant	 i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too i do not really i have never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like i actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like stuff in the past or present or future stuff that is coming up as far as like i am really relaxed i really could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it is kinda like a therapy thing for me cause i do not like i guess you could say it is a kinda drug because i do not think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that is happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it is actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it is kind of like catch twenty two or whatever but 
438.633	439.003	ellie	h
