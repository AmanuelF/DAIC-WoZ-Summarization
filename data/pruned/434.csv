418.055	472.315	participant	controlling my temper i am very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred i do not lose my temper do not like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i do not want anybody to be frightened or anything there is no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and and i believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely do not want that
473.16	478.469	ellie	yeah tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
480.28	556.27	participant	well i was just telling you about it was it was my mother is husband and to tell you the truth i could have handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama is eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother like i do not like this you need you need to take care of this because i am do not know how long i can keep my composure as far as this cause i have been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that is her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me that i do not like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i should have just left i should have just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those six nine months i can not get back
