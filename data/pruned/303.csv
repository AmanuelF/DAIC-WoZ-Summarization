465.436	509.496	participant	happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had i was working on my bachelor is degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it is never too late so i feel like i will take some classes now that i am with metro to help me move up the ladder so that is why i am starting a class next week
502.416	512.206	ellie	yeah that sounds like a great situation 
512.196	513.446	participant	thank you
513.7959999999998	516.806	ellie	what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
517.656	577.6659999999998	participant	hm well the advice i would have gave myself that i probably would not have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would have stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would have remained in school i probably would not have had kids early you know rather i probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that is a plus you know in anybody is shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career
682.2760000000002	683.346	ellie	tell me more about that
683.3860000000002	703.456	participant	she is she is kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i have been telling her over the years you know different things and it is it is kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite
702.8560000000001	703.4060000000002	ellie	
704.066	719.316	participant	and now she is she regretting it you know cause she is like my mom told me this you know mom i am doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bp her head a couple of times to get it it is kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it is up to you to make the change
720.2860000000002	723.2260000000001	ellie	yeah how hard is that
723.6360000000002	740.456	participant	it is very frustrating because it is like i am talking to a wall and she is not hearing me and i am like it seem like it is taking forever for her to change but it is left up to the individual whenever they are ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they will make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but
