205.7	207.26	ellie	do you find it easy to be a parent 
208.35	232.61	participant	no it is it is it is very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it is like you are fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it is just difficult to deal with that but other than that it it is okay but it is being a parent is never easy 
234.59	237.92	ellie	yeah what is the hardest thing about being a parent 
240.35	283.71	participant	 the hardest thing about being a parent i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they do not make mistakes or so that they do not get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they do not so it gets very annoying sometimes that you know what is coming and you give them the info and they do not wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it is it is sad and then they wanna come to you and you are like ugh i tried to tell you but you can not be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so 
284.2	286.44	ellie	 h that sounds really hard 
287.51	308.22	participant	 yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it is hard to watch but it is a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you are happy they got it
