88.305	89.925	ellie	how does it compare to la
91.54	114.86	participant	h it is it is very different i think it is a lot more mellow it is way more like suburbia it is nice it there is something comforting about it but it is always like i get a little restless when i am there and look forward to coming back here where there is a little more action 
114.759	117.72	ellie	 why did you move to la
118.35	120.82	participant	i went to grad school at usc
121.564	125.735	ellie	cool how easy was it for you to get used to living in la
127.14	158.56	participant	 it was it was not bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consing that i really did not have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i my life was not my own so that made it kind of easier i guess and also i was like in a counity of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it was not bad
166.56799999999996	167.97799999999995	ellie	how did you decide to do that
169.6	196.63	participant	h i had an epiphany one day i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i did not really know what i wanted to do and just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and i realized that movies movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school
197.178	200.554	ellie	that is great are you still doing that
201.6	212.55	participant	 a little bit yes and no it is i do not i am so i am like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i have been producing like freelance producer 
213.362	214.562	ellie	what is your dream job
216.4	280.38	participant	 that is so the question of the moment i think that i do not necessarily have like a a job title that is my dream job but i knowit is sort of what i want and cause basically like i have been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i do not wanna do that anymore so i am looking for something that is stable you know full time nice benefits and i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry and i like you know what i love about producing is that it is just like there is constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that is you know it is always interesting and exciting so i am sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that 
280.786	284.525	ellie	i understand it can be tough to find a good job these days

420.49	457.73	participant	 what do i do to relax i i mean depending where i am like if it is you know if i am like at work or something and i am stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way if i am home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a tv show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief 
458.073	462.182	ellie	okay how are you at controlling your temper

486.68	488.22	ellie	how did you feel in that moment

750.7819999999998	753.632	ellie	what sort of changes have you noticed since you have been going to therapy
755.194	809.08	participant	 i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it is it gives me a more heightened like kind of self awareness so that as opposed to just like kind of just reacting to situations i am like just like noticing more what is going on and it just helps to i do not know it is just helpful i do not really i do not really know how to explain it 
809.2460000000002	814.939	ellie	okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy
814.6339999999999	850.73	participant	 h i do not know i it is probably not good that i can not think of i can not think of anything eh maybe over over christmas being at home with my family
852.123	853.283	ellie	can you tell me about that
852.3	901.04	participant	yeah well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me so when i was there with them it just it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace
901.748	902.428	ellie	aw
902.83	903.19	participant	
904.221	905.581	ellie	that is so good to hear
906.7	907.0	participant	
906.981	908.671	ellie	how would your best friend describe you
910.66	941.75	participant	 i think she would describe me as funny and smart and a good listener nonjudgmental i do not know is that enough 
941.307	947.68	ellie	okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
949.22	1100.97	participant	 h okay so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it was not technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and i had a it very small company the boss had a really good relationship with my boss and he sort of he sort of out of nowhere told me that he was like downsizing basically and essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they are the they are really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he is like so i am gonna i am gonna have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i would not be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i would not you know it would not be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making excuse me but and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you are fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slaed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so
1100.347	1101.227	ellie	oh no
1101.34	1137.03	participant	yeah so it just like it was a really it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired and it was just like that the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can not really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that is like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that is what i wish 
1133.67	1144.296	ellie	yeah i am sorry what would you say are some of your best qualities
1144.99	1173.23	participant	 let is see i a very loyal person i am smart i am organized i very like caring kind i am conscientious and i work hard 
1174.404	1179.869	ellie	that is great what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1180.86	1218.54	participant	 man i think to be more confident and less passive to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves
