517.156	520.992	ellie	what are some ways that you are different as a parent than your parents
521.01	551.81	participant	wow completely my parents iigrated here from central america in the sixties i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it is just that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home making sure we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
554.8290000000002	558.429	ellie	tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
558.68	605.81	participant	divorcing my first husband cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has was is this is not virtual it happened we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while and then i just made some decisions to where i did not wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that is all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
606.557	607.987	ellie	what made you decide to do that
608.7	662.97	participant	 my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i did not feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that is just who i am and those were the very areas that he did not validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i am not i am not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he was not prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self esteem i you know i was not perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return

666.872	669.312	ellie	how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep
669.7	707.94	participant	you know what it is actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i am ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i am not being sanctimonious or acting as if i am pollyanna but i believe in karma i am a god fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there is something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
707.7589999999999	711.1060000000001	ellie	that is good how have you been feeling lately
711.72	742.9	participant	really good light you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter is a teenager so she is kinda coming into her own so that is a different relationship she is opposite of me i am i am actually very easygoing very bohemian style she is very social very you know just out there so i am having to just kinda find our balance but overall it is just i i will not complain i am very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not

758.02	797.83	participant	really happy let is see it is at home and i think it was when wow different things running through my head i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship i am not trying to be her best friend but yet that does not mean she can not talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
798.6260000000002	799.306	ellie	aw
799.37	799.66	participant	
803.808	805.498	ellie	how would your best friend describe you
806.41	837.335	participant	 i am easygoing i am fun i am just very you know eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i am in i am very honest i am very real and just you know bold if i have to be i am just very adult i am an adult woman and you know they would just decribe or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i do not i do not deal with b s 
837.291	842.298	ellie	 what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
842.39	876.28	participant	h what could i change about myself probably cosmetic things maybe i would just that is not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself sounds weird that i would say not much nothing really i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i am a i am super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i am not being selfish or i am not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure i am not offending anybody
877.092	880.4019999999998	ellie	 h is there anything you regret
882.88	918.205	participant	i do not have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it is it is natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can not you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that is true that is just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i am supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i am to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
919.512	924.379	ellie	i understand what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
924.515	962.375	participant	h be real with myself that is that is one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you know get to know who i am learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the with the innate things that are a part of me do not try to revamp do not try to revamp myself or try to become something that i am not i would have still chosen the same marketing career to still i would have still climbed the same corporate ladders but i would have done it from a more internal place not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i would have just been more true to myself and that way i would not have had any kind of resentments
964.627	966.927	ellie	what are you most proud of in your life
967.285	1002.3	participant	my family my my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that is where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life is this life this body in this leased vehicle that i am in all i am gonna do or all i am gonna be is an epitaph somewhere in a cementary scrubbedentry and i am always just true to that i mean i i have been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that that is where my true fulfillment comes from
