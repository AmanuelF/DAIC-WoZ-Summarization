631.477	631.927	ellie	h
631.594	665.586	participant	and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i could barely walk and yeah i i think running off and like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like eating too much and like just overeating cause i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we did not physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death
657.523	671.9639999999998	ellie	yeah tell me about the hardest decision you have ever had to make
673.342	719.7189999999998	participant	 h i do not think i have had a singular hard decision i have had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is do not you know do not regret do not regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites you have missed and that is like had to come with me that is like had to i have had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept
715.456	715.926	ellie	
720.4889999999998	740.5189999999999	participant	and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i have had to make is i would say probably probably to break up with my ex probably
741.195	742.625	ellie	what made you decide to do that
743.929	849.613	participant	 xxx ooh where do i begin my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word she did some things that i was not entirely comfortable with just to the the people around her and to me and i you know they say you are supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you can not forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that can not be undone they just they are they are the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we despite us trying it just it did not work out i mean i i i do not know i do not really wanna talk about exactly what happened
850.199	857.22	ellie	okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
858.67	985.15	participant	oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening h i do not you know that is hard katrina just the experience of katrina for starters my my ex i i guess between those two it is it is kinda hard i would i would actually rather lean towards katrina cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you do not exactly know about it but in two thousand five this giant storm hit new orleans louisiana killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town and i i lost a lot of friends during the storm i mean i am kind of i am getting over it but it is still it is it is still there and i think i i do not know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there is just there is nothing the only thing you can do is is just think that that was like a freak accident and it will never happen again though i live in la and you know earthquakes they could happen and i just think oh i would rather rather know that it is coming than not know it is coming
