72.824	84.926	participant	 it took a long time to i have been living here for about a year since i graduated so there is been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though

97.891	108.426	participant	the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality tv show for a while
108.815	111.006	ellie	yeah how do you know them
111.371	115.201	participant	one is from college and the other one we found on craigslist
312.848	313.538	ellie	okay

317.172	317.982	participant	
318.958	321.208	ellie	what are some things that make you really mad
324.024	363.55800000000005	participant	 that is a good question i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and conceited but it is mostly how people react to different situations can make me angry i guess
363.76	369.93	ellie	yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
370.68	401.69	participant	 yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he is trying to be healthy and workout and save money and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he is not saving money and he is not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him cause i am constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he is like i am gonna do it i am gonna do it so he is constantly breaking promises that is another thing that makes me angry is people that do not follow through
390.24	405.1	ellie	 yeah do you feel that way often
406.385	409.485	participant	about other people or about myself or angry
410.559	411.879	ellie	whatever comes to your mind
412.361	423.0	participant	xxxx angry i guess i will go with that no i do not feel angry often
424.4	428.059	ellie	okay what is your dream job
428.864	491.958	participant	dang it that is a tough one how bout just getting paid to be me i do not know that what i am kind of trying to figure out right now cause i quit my full time job cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i am trying to look for a second job to support myself my dream job i do not know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i would love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it is something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it is a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it is just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can not really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
480.566	491.166	ellie	 yeah
492.49	505.271	participant	something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i do not know something in that realm i guess
505.867	508.85	ellie	okay do you travel a lot
508.991	520.246	participant	i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we have gone to gosh seven eight different countries i have lived in three or four different countries
520.587	521.077	ellie	wow
521.057	534.32	participant	i have not traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome

543.19	544.8	ellie	what do you enjoy about traveling
545.626	566.55	participant	in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it is nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it is nice to stir things up
567.135	571.234	ellie	i see what you mean i would love to hear about one of your trips
572.729	601.059	participant	oh gosh okay i am trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i do not know it is funny even though i have been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there is five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
600.5169999999998	601.487	ellie	oh my gosh
601.477	655.94	participant	i know needless to say it is like when you are that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others nerves but it was really fun and like even though i have traveled so many places i realized that there is like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i do not know natural wonders also really amaze me cause those things are not man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it is like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it is beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that is natural and beautiful or something that is different too
816.9110000000002	817.5310000000002	ellie	nice
818.194	852.068	participant	yes but yeah usually it is been kind of like down because i am just trying to find like what i am supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it is just groceries like i can not even afford groceries so it is just hard to like live this way especially after you have paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it is a little bit frustrating but there is a lot of people in the same situation
852.2389999999998	854.2589999999999	ellie	yeah i am sorry
854.5889999999998	855.4889999999998	participant	it is all good

885.505	912.143	participant	oh let is see to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cause i am one of those people if i am not gonna be the best at something then i am just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would have told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i am not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago
911.193	912.003	ellie	like what
912.839	965.411	participant	well that would have made me like twelve so i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would have continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things cause it is like oh i am not good at it so i am not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes i do not know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i do not know just expand myself more rather than like find something i am good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i am good i just stay for good i do not try to go above that if that makes any sense
964.212	969.882	ellie	yeah yeah what do you do to relax
972.545	998.06	participant	 right now it is super lame but i watch tv but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it is just like since i am on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i am done so
