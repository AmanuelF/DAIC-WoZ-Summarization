368.23	398.57	participant	the hardest thing not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it is a lot of stress on yourself 
399.483	400.833	ellie	that sounds really hard
401.1	401.53	participant	yeah
403.153	405.443	ellie	do you think that maybe you are being a little hard on yourself
406.7	410.3	participant	yeah definitely
412.92800000000005	416.767	ellie	what are some ways that you are different as a parent than your parents
420.98	461.66	participant	 h i think i am different from my mom because i am a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily
462.306	462.836	ellie	yeah
462.48	464.53	participant	into a different person 
465.681	466.151	ellie	 h
467.1	467.4	participant	so
499.774	511.541	ellie	sometimes when i am feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it is not hawaii but it is the best i have got what do you do to relax
522.08	544.65	participant	well i have tried to meditate sometimes but i do not really stick with it often enough i have tried to like go for walks but i do not always do that and i do not always stick with it so
548.059	548.529	ellie	 h
549.4	550.71	participant	yeah that is about it
551.498	553.558	ellie	how are you at controlling your temper
555.99	568.96	participant	 i would say i am a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think
570.639	573.689	ellie	when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
576.12	649.04	participant	h last night but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she is got four people living in in one room so it is kind of stressful it is really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i am just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she is gonna be asking for things you do not really wanna do that is just how my sister is so the house is messy and it is crowded and every day they are asking for rides and my husband he is avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he does not wanna be there anymore and i am just saying that he is gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion so h
649.109	649.9490000000002	ellie	that sucks
650.13	651.28	participant	it does 
705.2189999999998	706.0989999999998	ellie	oh no
706.88	768.73	participant	yeah they are gonna be saying that i am not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she is my stepmom she is my dad is fifth wife and she is she really does not she is really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you are we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that is fine when you are a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i am in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules anyway 
767.7819999999998	770.6360000000002	ellie	right that makes sense
771.06	771.57	participant	yeah
773.057	774.597	ellie	how did you feel in that moment
776.78	845.63	participant	 in that moment just really frustrated because they do not listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they are taking away my right to parent and it is something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i have read all the magazines and i have read the books and i am really i know what i am talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that have not done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i am a bad parent it is really hard to believe so i feel very disrespected unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things 
845.893	852.91	ellie	yeah i am sorry how easy is it for you to get a good night is sleep
855.34	892.04	participant	 i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i am so my doctor gave me that she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you are in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily 
893.015	895.813	ellie	h are they triggered by something
896.96	919.55	participant	yeah i am always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that is happening and like i do not deserve to have my son taken from me because i am a really good mom you know 
920.32	920.76	ellie	yeah
921.6	961.09	participant	and i am too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i am a good mom i just i do not really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son is dad does he has more money than me and right now i am trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that does not mean i am not a good mom h
