said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there is hundreds of choices and i said not really because it is gut wise is only one and it does not really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it does not matter whether there is a
