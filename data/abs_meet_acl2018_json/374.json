it was not technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and i had a it very small company the boss had a really good relationship with my boss and he sort of he sort of out of nowhere told me that he was like downsizing basically and essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they are the they are really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he is like so i am gonna i am gonna have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i would not be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i would not you know it would not be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making excuse me but and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you are fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slaed

like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can not really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that is like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that is what i wish
