to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i do not know if you are familiar with calpirg but we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long i did not get the full percentage i should have stayed notil i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i did not get the full amount but that is okay eh i i found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis so i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should have kinda waited notil i was fifty five
