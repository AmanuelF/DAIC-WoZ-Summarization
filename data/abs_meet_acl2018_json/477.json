or or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here is this beautiful coat it is a hundred dollars i want it i am gonna buy it it do not think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that is effectively what your money could do if you did not spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and i think i have been much more a conser than a saver and so i wish that i had been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago"}]}
