very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time is passed i wish i would invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really did not invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could have easily done it via email or it is hard to call everybody personally but i wish that is something cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you did not tell me notil after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i am not really mad at myself about something i probably should have been more prepared for also something that was coming was inevitable so"}, {"from": 991.977, "until": 996.7639999999999, "speaker": "ellie", "text": "i see tell me about your relationship with your family"},
